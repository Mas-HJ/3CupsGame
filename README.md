# 3 Cups Game

A classic shell game built with React and TypeScript. Track the ball hidden under one of three cups as they shuffle around, then pick the right cup.

## How to Play

1. A ball is placed under a random cup and revealed briefly
2. The cups lower to hide the ball
3. The cups shuffle positions -- keep your eye on the ball!
4. Click the cup you think hides the ball
5. The cups lift to show whether you guessed correctly

## Difficulty Levels

- **Easy** -- 3 shuffles
- **Medium** -- 6 shuffles
- **Hard** -- 10 shuffles

Shuffle speed accelerates as the round progresses.
